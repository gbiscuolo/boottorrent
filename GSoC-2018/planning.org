#+DESCRIPTION: P2P Network Boot with BitTorrent
#+AUTHOR: Giovanni Biscuolo
#+EMAIL: g@xelera.eu

#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
In this project, we explore the solutions that allow P2P network booting of Linux based systems and then create an easy to use and distribution agnostic system of the said solution. We also aim to, at the very least, package the solution as a standard Debian package.
