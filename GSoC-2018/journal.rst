Got project to work end-to-end.
Was facing some problems with the clients being unable to discovery seeds but, finally, was able to sort it.

* Implemented basic TUI for clients in Golang.
* Implemented download and kexec on clients.
* Added Hefur as a tracker for the torrents.
* Pushed some documentation.
