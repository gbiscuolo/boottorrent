BootTorrent allows distributed P2P BitTorrent based network booting of various Operating systems.

The advantage of BootTorrent over standard network booting is that the bottleneck caused by a central server serving the image is reduced and BootTorrent reduces the linear scaling factor in total time to bring a cluster online fully functional by utilizing Peer-to-Peer protocol. The nodes share the image data among themselves, hence, improved boot times.

If you have considerable number of independent computers at your disposal and youâ€™re looking to simply deploy any given System image(s) (that may have been hand-crafted according to your needs), such as that of a compute node for an HPC/ML cluster, over the whole network, consider BootTorrent. Upgrading is also as simple as rebooting the nodes in the network after the upgrade has started seeding from the central computer.

Architecture
------------

* TODO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

.. (atrent) also refer to usecases, usecases are NOT referenced in any other file, why?!?

.. (shreyansh) I'll write usecases in simpler terms for a new user. They were linked before but were too technical, link you previously said. I'll rewrite and put them back as soon as I get an opportunity.

Features
